# Flappy Logo Game Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design and features of the Flappy Logo Game, a Flutter-based mobile game. The game is built using the Flame engine and features simple, one-touch controls. The player navigates a flying logo through a series of pipes, with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.

## Current Features

*   **Game Mechanics:** The player controls a circular logo that "flaps" upwards with each tap. Gravity constantly pulls the logo down. The game ends if the logo collides with a pipe or the ground.
*   **Scoring:** The player scores one point for each pipe successfully passed.
*   **Game State Management:** The game manages states for 'mainMenu', 'playing', and 'gameOver'.
*   **Simple Graphics:** The game features a static background, a player represented by a circular image, and simple rectangular pipes.

## Planned Enhancements

### Control and Gameplay Improvements

*   **Easier Controls:** Introduce "Up" and "Down" buttons for more direct and continuous control over the player's movement, making the game more accessible.
*   **Additional Controllers:** The new button-based controls will provide an alternative to the tap-to-flap mechanic.

### Visual and Aesthetic Upgrades

*   **3D-like Appearance:**
    *   **Player:** The player's circular shape will be rendered with gradients and shadows to make it appear as a 3D sphere.
    *   **Pipes:** The pipes will be updated with gradients and shadows to give them a cylindrical, 3D look.
    *   **Parallax Background:** A multi-layered parallax background will be implemented to create a sense of depth and make the game world feel more dynamic.
*   **Realistic Ground:** The ground will be enhanced with a textured and repeating image to provide a more realistic and visually appealing look.

This blueprint will be updated as new features are implemented and the game evolves.
